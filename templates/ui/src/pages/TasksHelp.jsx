      <h2>Create your own UI with Claude</h2>
      <p>
        Open Claude in this project's folder (the one with <code>api</code> and{' '}
        <code>ui</code>) and give it this — change the name and the fields:
      </p>
      <pre className="app-help-prompt">{PROMPT}</pre>
      <button type="button" className="app-btn app-btn-quiet" onClick={copy}>
        {copied ? 'Copied' : 'Copy prompt'}
      </button>
      <p>
        Add behaviour in the same message if you want it — "a Mark active button
        on each row", "Region is required when Area is over 100". When Claude is
        done, restart the sign-in service and the API: the menu item appears and
        the table is created.
      </p>

      <h3>This page is an example</h3>
      <p>
        A task has a title, a status, a due date and a description. Neither the
        list nor the form is written by hand — both are <strong>screens</strong>,
        and the tasks are saved in an ordinary <code>tasks</code> table with one
        column per field.
      </p>

      <h3>Change it</h3>
      <p>
        Open <strong>Configure UI</strong> in the settings menu (top right) and{' '}
        <strong>Design form</strong> on Tasks. Add a field, move one, change a
        label or a colour — then <strong>Publish</strong>. The table gains its
        new column as you publish.
      </p>

      <h3>Or by hand</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure UI → Forms → New form</strong>: label and key, design,
        publish, add to menu — no code. The full steps for a form with its own page, hooks and
        model are in <code>CLAUDE.md</code>, under "Create a new UI".
      </p>

      <h3>More than saving</h3>
      <p>
        In the browser — a value added before saving, rows filtered for display,
        an extra button on each row: <code>ui/src/pages/EditTask.jsx</code>.
        Every method calls <code>super</code>; change the one you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the server — a check against other records, an email afterwards, a
        list only managers see: <code>api/screens/task/task.hooks.js</code>.
      </p>

      <h3>Two things that catch people</h3>
      <ul className="app-help-notes">
        <li>
          Once a screen is published, the <em>database</em> holds its design.
          Editing its <code>.screen.json</code> afterwards changes nothing — use
          Forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          A new menu entry is remembered for ten minutes. Restart the sign-in
          service if you want it immediately.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
