// THE SCREENS THIS APP SHIPS WITH — designed with @xeplr/ui-factory.
//
// Each entity is two screens: a list, and the add / edit form the list opens
// in a popup. Their records live in a REAL table named for the entity
// ("tasks"), one column per field.
//
// On startup (bin/www) every screen here that has never been published is
// published — which creates its table. After that the DATABASE holds the
// design: change it in the app's Configure UI → Forms, where Publish changes the
// table to match. Editing a .screen.json later changes nothing for an
// already-published screen.
//
// ADD ONE: follow "Create a new UI" in the project's CLAUDE.md — or ask Claude
// to, with the prompt there. Every form's folder holds the same files:
//
//   screens/<form>/<form>.entity.json       its name and fields
//   screens/<form>/<form>-list.screen.json  the list
//   screens/<form>/<form>-edit.screen.json  the add / edit form
//   screens/<form>/<form>.hooks.js          server hooks — save / get / delete
//   screens/<form>/<form>.model.js          server model — getters / setters

module.exports = {
  // Publish order is worked out for you: a table before the dropdowns that
  // point at it, lists last.
